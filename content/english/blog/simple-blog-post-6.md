We have always wondered how life on other planets would be like. How do the look like? How do the communicate amongst themselves. But the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about our search for extraterrestrial like is how to confirm their presence. How to be sure that life exits there? For many years, water was considered essential evidence, at least for our missions on moon and mars, for the presence of life. But recently NASA scientist published a research which claimed that  Sugars and their derivatives are essential to all terrestrial life.

Published in ‘Nature’, the article written by Michel Nuevo, George Cooper & Scott A. Sandford, they reported the detection of 2-deoxyribose (the sugar of DNA) and several deoxysugar derivatives in residues produced from the ultraviolet irradiation of ice mixtures consisting of H2O and CH3OH. 

"We don't yet know whether life is common in the universe, but we're pretty sure the presence of life's building blocks is not a limiting factor," said Michel Nuevo, a researcher at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley and the lead author of the paper.

These types of compound are routinely found in meteorites along with compounds like amino acids. n 2016, another team of researchers in France made a similar laboratory discovery of ribose, the sugar of RNA used by the body to make proteins and considered a possible precursor to DNA in the first life forms on early Earth.

"For more than two decades we've asked ourselves if the chemistry we find in space can make the kinds of compounds essential to life. So far, we haven't picked a single broad set of molecules that can't be produced," said Scott Sandford, a senior scientist in the Ames astrochemistry lab and an author on the new paper.

They hope to carry on this research and apply it to our quest for extraterrestrial life.
